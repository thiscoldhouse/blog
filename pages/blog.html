  <p>As you can probably tell, the site itself is nothing fancy. It consists solely of static files and is written in simple html/css/js, with heavy use of jquery, and hosted on an AWS micro instance using NGINX.

  <p>It's a single page app. I'm not usually a front-end person, but when I do dabble, I'm always frustrated by front-end frameworks (like angular. Actually, especially angular), so I kept it really simple and rolled out my own super simple routing. Pretty much all of the javascript is in main.js, if you're curious.
