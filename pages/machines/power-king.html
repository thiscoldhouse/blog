  <h2>1973 Power King</h2>
  <p>
    This was my first machine, and I have since sold it to find a new home. It's a "garden tractor," in the true sense, it had a double transmission, hydraulics, and a mower deck. It had a Kohler 10HP that put out so much more power than you'd think, and those cast iron Kohlers are wonderful engines.
