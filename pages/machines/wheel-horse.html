  <h2>Current Project: Wheel Horse</h2>

    I just picked up this wonderful machine from craigslist in the spring of 2021 for a cool $100. Of course, it didn't start! I bought it because the <a href="#machines/craftsman-mower">craftsman</a> is such a horrendous piece of engineering and has some sort of carb problem this spring, so I figure I might as well fix a machine that's worth fixing.

    So far, I've bypassed the starter solenoid with a momentary starter switch, cleaned out the carb, replaced a horrendously foul spark plug, and fixed the wiring to the fuel pump, and it starts up fine now. There's still some sort of problem with the transmission, so watch this space for updates!
