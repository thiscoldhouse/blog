    I absolutely adore this machine. I use it just about all the time, and it's so powerful, parts are easy to find, it's easy to maintain. I don't really know what else to say, I just love it.

    Like all great things in life, it came from craigslist. When I bought it, it only ran in two cylinders (it has four), the air intake system was all sorts of messed up, and the hydraulics didn't work quite right. It spent a good couple months immobile in the grass, but now I use it all the time!

  <p>My property is old, and as such, I find a lot of buried things that time has forgotten. I have probably pulled out a mile of fencing that was totally overgrown with grass, as well as the occasional satellite dish and other goodies</p>
