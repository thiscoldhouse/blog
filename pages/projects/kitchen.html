  <h2>The Kitchen</h2>
  <p>It's been a while since my last update. We finally took on the kitchen. As it stands now, we're almost done... almost ...</p>
  <p> Here's some before pictures (click to go through slideshow):</p>

    It's actually kind of a cool room, though not really my style, but it has one major flaw: it is impossible to heat. First off, it is the size of a small house. Second, it is entirely made shiplap. The thing with shiplap is that it has seams, and these seams are tiny little holes. If you don't seal behind the shiplap (with something like spray foam) then what you have for walls is more of an air filter than an air barrier.

  <p>
    In fact, when we had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blower_door">blower door test</a> done, the kitchen was draftier on its own than most houses! Opening a window barely made a difference, the walls themselve were letting in that much air.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, we had to devise a plan. We decided we'd cut the room in roughly half, leave the half with the giant windows as a sunroom/conservatory/oranger type room (aka not really heat it and fill it with plants). In the dividing wall, we decided to put big windows and french doors, that way in the winter we can look upon the greenery in our sunroom and keep hope alive for spring.
  </p>
  <p>Oh, and also stained glass, because stained glass rules!</p>
  <p>So here we are, with the bottom of the wall framed, trying to figure out where the stained glass windows will go.

  <p>We also decided to plaster the walls for that sweet combination of period look, durability, and air seal. That job I hired out! I've plastered exactly one room in my life, I've hired it out since. Here are some progress shots, the process involves putting up sheetrock, doing the seams similar to how you'd do regular drywall, and then skim coating the whole thing:

    And here, a brief interlude on electrical and plumbing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I often don't write about them much on the blog, but I do spend a ton of time on them. I don't really find them fun to talk about, and looking at pictures of dangling wires or pipes with actual shit in them is just not that appealing. Now that I've said that, here is a picture of dangling wires:

    So my house has 1 main breaker panel and 7 (yes, 7) subpanels. The kitchen alone had something like 10+ circuits in it. Each room has like 10 light switches and lord knows what they even do. It is probably the most over-engineered mechanicals I have ever seen, and every time I open up a wall I always have to solve some complicated puzzle from hell to simplify the room's electrical situation. The kichen's was actually so complicated I had to hire an electrician to consult who spent more than a whole day with me trying to figure it out. He thought it'd take just one morning, we were working well into the evening and then the next day!

    OK boring part is over, let's get to the fun part, TRIM! And with that, we have the mandatory This Cold Truck glamor shot!

    The exciting challenge of getting two doors through one door!

    Then the paneling for that wall.

    Here's a pano of what the room looked like around halfway:
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image">

  <p>
    At this point, I had some members of my family visiting to help, and they started priming as I finished the trim work, which was SUPER helpful!!!! </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/kitchenpanopainting.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>Trim done!!!</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/kitchenpanodone.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>
    At this point, I realized I had taken no photos of the stained glass because the staging blocks the view of the top of the room. So, here's some pics of that installed and trim with painting underway.

  <p> Painting took me 5 full days of just painting and sleeping. It was horrible! </p>

    Then, the floors! I use oil + wax finishes. For this floor, I sanded smooth with an orbital sander, applied one coat of Boiled Linseed Oil, waited 24 hours, then applied 2 coats of wax with buffing in between.
  </p>


  <div class="inline-image">

    <img src="images/kitchenfloors8.jpg" class="slideshow" style="display:none;">
  </div>
  <p>I'm really happy with the results and I plan on using the same finishing technique throughout the house! It has so much more life and depth than poly, and it can be touched up in spots and buffed to bring it right back to brand new.
  </p>
  <p>And that's about it for now! Here's a pic of the kitchen in mostly-finished state. We still haven't decided a few things about counters and tables, but it works for now and we're happy with it!</img>
