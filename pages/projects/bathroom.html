  <h2>Upstairs Bathroom </h2>
  <p>We normally call this room the upstairs bathroom, but the master bathroom is also upstairs so it feels wrong. But I suppose whatever is written on the circuit breaker is the official name for the room, so "upstairs bathroom" it is.

  <p>As usual, I apologize and take personal responsibility for the quality (or lack thereof) of all photos</p>

  <p>Problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shower is a sad place with soggy drywall</li>
    <li>Shower drain dumps water into below room (and caused the violent transformation of said room's ceiling drywall into floor rubble)</li>
    <li>Beadboard and window are super drafty, causing an unpleasant toilet user experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    First things first: demo. I didn't take any pictures, because how many more pictures do I need of rubble in a truck, 3 years into this project?
  </p>
  <p>
    Next: plumbing. The previous showerhead was on that wall that didn't need to exist, so I moved the plumbing to the far wall. Here it is!

    Because I plan on living here for a lon time, I also positioned the shower such that the wall is shared with the master bedroom's closet, so that I could cut a permanent access pane. Just in case!

    The next step is to put up the hardibacker, mud all the seams and screw holes with mortar, and paint redguard over the whole thing. Make sure to use the special kind of mesh tape for this. I put 2 coats of redguard over everywhere there's tile, and 3-4 over the actual wet area of the room.

    Now tiling. Oh my god, so much tiling:

    I took a wonderfully satisfying video of removing all the little spacers, but I don't have the technological capabilities of putting a video on here just yet, so I guess you'll have to take my word for it!

  <p>Anyways, then there's grouting!</p>

  <p>Plumbing roughed in, ready to do the floors. I forgot to take a pic of the floors done without the plumbing fixtures in, so from there we'll just skip right to done.</p>

  <p>Floors done, sink in, toilet in, and shower stall in! The shower stall was a pain to assemble, it took more than a full day!</p>
