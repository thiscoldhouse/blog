  <h2>The Master Bedroom</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, I did a pretty bad job getting before pictures of the master, but I assure you it looked exactly like the rest of the house when I bought it: beadboard, primed drywall, drywall tape peeling at many joints. I did, however, take some pictures of the sort of quality work I've come to expect when opening the walls!

  <p>I'm pretty sure what happened was that someone ran out of 2x4s on a Friday afternoon, and they figured they can just put up the longest piece they have, screw it to the next stud, and throw up the drywall before anyone notices
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I always find when I open up a wall in this house, whoever did the drywalling always dumped their garbage into the walls:

  <p>Fun!</p>

    First things first, we fixed this framing disaster. Click through for a super high-tech slideshow!

    And here's the old framing, along with the rest of the room, disassembled and in the truck.

    Now, we'll magically jump ahead to the room replastered. I hired a local plaster contractor, and he does absolutely fabulous work--I plan to hire him from now on!

    For this room (and for the attached bathroom, that'll be another post), I decided to go with stained red oak for the trim. So here we are, deciding:
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">
    <img src="images/master-bedroom-samples.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>
    We ended up going with the top one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn't take any pictures of the painting process, because it's boring and it sucks, but you can see the color in these next pictures. After painting, I redid the floors. I love redoing these old floors, and I have developed a technique.
  <p>I sand them:</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/master-bedroom-sanded.jpg">
  </div> 
  <p>
    I put on a heavy coat of Boiled Linseed Oil, I let that soak for 24 hours, and then I wipe off the excess:    
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/master-bedroom-blo.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>
    Then I put on 3 coats of floor paste wax, buffing between coats. This is the finished product:
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/master-bedroom-waxed.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>
    Looks pretty good!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it's time for the trim. The process here involved cutting the trim in the room, making sure it all fits, taking it to the shop to stain and finish, then nailing it up!
  </p>
  <p>Here's testing the fit:</p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">

  </div> 
  <p>
    For the wood treatment, I used a "hickory" gel stain, and two coats of slightly thinned down amber shellac. Basically every surface in my shop turned into a drying area, it was a lot of staining!

  <p>The two windows, all done:</p>

    Of course, I love any project where I get to use a coping saw. So satisfying!

  <p>And progress continues:</p>

  <p>Don't forgot those outlets, too, they have to match!</p>

  <p>And voila, project is done, furniture is moved in, and we're enjoying the room!</p>
