  <h2>Transporting a stove: how to move 500lbs by yourself and still have a back</h2>
  <p>
    I've been trawling craigslist for a while for a wood stove that'll keep up with our 3000+ sqft house, and I found this one! It's an Alderlea T6, allegedly capable of 100,000 BTU/hr! The problem: it was in Connecticut, which is about 3.5 hours away from me, and I don't know 3 strapping young lad/lassies willing to spend a whole day to load it into my truck. But, when faced with a lack of friends, we turn to engineering to solve our problems!

  <h3>The Gantry</h3>
  <p> So here's the thing I built:</p>

  <br>
  <p>The basic idea is pretty simple, the gantry comes together with 6 bolts. The top piece is two 2x6s, the side pieces are 4x4s, and then there's the little 2x4 bottom with the crossbraces. I also brought a floor jack, just in case.

  <p>Disassembled, in the truck:</p>

  <p>
    And, honestly, it worked like a charm. The previous owner was extremely skeptical when I showed up by myself, but I assured him that I was a professional craigslist buyer. He looked even more skeptical when I started assembling the gantry.

    Here it is once it was loaded onto the ratchet straps. I built a little scrap wood platform at first as I was lifting it until I felt confident in the system, then I kept the floor jack near it and raised, just in case.

  <p>At this point, the seller's entire family and a few neighbors are watching. This process took about 10 minutes, only because the ratchet straps would fill up pretty fast, so you'd have to loosen the straps one-by-one and unravel them, which was a little bit annoying, but overall super minor!</p>
  <p>And boom:</p>
