  <h2>Woodshed</h2>
  <p>This is a pretty simple shed build, but it's been wonderful to have! I made it so the back and front are both open, ideally, this'll make stacking it with wood a lot easier. Wood gets dumped behind it and taken from the front. We'll see how well the system actually works!</p>
  <p>I didn't take a lot of pictures, but here's a before, a few progress shots, and an after</p>
