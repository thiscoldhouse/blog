  <h2> The Living Room + inaugural blogpost! </h2>

  <p> Besides all the constant odds and ends you have to do when you buy an old house, we decided our first major, whole-room project would be the living room. Why? Well, the way our house is laid out, the living room is huge, and you have to pass through it to get almost anywhere in the house. So we figured we should knock it out while we were stil living out of boxes without central heat. What's a little more misery, right?
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>The room</h3>
  <p> Here's what we were dealing with: </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/living-room-before.jpg">
  </div>
  <p> Note this is the picture from the listing, so it truly is really flattering. In real life, I couldn't quite tell if the walls were just primed or painted, and they were pretty scuffed up and stained and such.
  </p>
  <p> But all in all, not too bad. The previous owner had removed some rotting, falling off plaster and drywalled the place. Though it was obviously a DIY job, it was pretty solid in this room (we'll talk about other rooms some other time!). Some of the closeups of the taping, especially between the wall and ceiling, weren't holding up too well - luckily I was going to put up crown anyway!
  </p>
  <p> If you keep reading this blog, you'll learn that I love trim. It's what really makes the room. This sorta-craftsmanish-pine shenanigans around the doors I think didn't do the room any favors and didn't make any coherent aesthetic.
  </p>
  <p> So after much thought, we decided on an Arts and Crafts style room. Why? Well, because it's awesome. We really loved the wallpaper, and we deicded to build the room out from there.
  </p>
  <br><h3>Crown-Moulding: A quick primer</h3>
  <p> This is an extremely crown-moulding-heavy project (and house, for that matter), I thought I'd give a quick primer on crown moulding. I make no claims about my way being right, but I get pretty consistent good results, so I plan on sticking with it.
  </p>
  <p> A lot of tutorials I read about crown moulding have a lot of complicated angle setting in order to be able to cut the piece flat. I much prefer to set the saw at the angle of the joint, and hold the piece at the angle it will be on the wall. I'd make a video, but it wouldn't be as good as <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/how-to-cut-crown-molding">This Old House's</a>, and since my blogname is an obvious homage/ripoff, I might as well link to theirs.
  </p>
  <p> I will add one big tip, though: Before I make the cut, I find it very helpful to make a light pencil mark around where the cut is going to be of the orientation/angle of your cut. That way, when you're jiggering your 11 foot length of crown moulding, and turning it upside down to cut it, you don't lose track of whether it's an inside corner, or an outside corner, or a scarf, etc.
  </p>
  <br><h3>The Prototype</h3>
  <p> So, here I am prototyping the window/door mouldings: </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/living-room-prototype.jpg">
  </div>
  <p> We liked this design a lot for a couple of reasons. First, we have the original antique windows (winterization of them will get another post =D), and we thought this was a flattering way to showcase them. Second, since we planned on wallpapering, and this house is almost 200 years old, there are no straight lines anywhere in the house. This way, the wallpaper won't be continuous, and that'll make it a lot easier to keep it relatively plumb. Third, it's aesthetically really compatible with the wallpaper we liked, and gave us plenty of trim surface area to really bring out the color schemes we were considering. Fourth, I could reuse some of the existing trim, which means I'm less likely to have to fix drywall. I hate working with drywall, given the option I'd rather plaster. Fuck drywall.
  </p>
  <br><h3>Doing it!</h3>
    <p> You can get a sense for the procedure here: Pop the top piece of casing off, cut it down to actually fit the window (instead of having weird random overhang), pop it back on. Put the new board, put the half-round to cover the seam. Then, the crown between the window and the ceiling.

  <p> Starting to feel really good about my progress! I took this picture before the very last piece went up, but then forgot to take one after. Woops.</p>

  <p>At this point in the project, it was solidly winter, and we still hadn't totally sorted out our central heating. Thankfully, we got an old Vermont Castings stove on craigslist and had it installed by a local company.

  <br><h3>So Much Painting</h3>
  <p>I didn't take any pictures of the caulking, but rest assured, there was a lot of caulking. It doesn't exactly make for good pictures, though.
  </p>
  <p>We had the paint store mix some color into the primer (at their recommendation). It still took too many damn layers, because painting is objectively the worst.

  <p> Painting [mostly] done!</p>
  <br><h3>Wallpaper</h3>
  <p>This part was brutal. In case you haven't noticed already, this is a really big room. I've wallpapered before, and I thought I knew what I was getting myself into, but oh man, the wallpapering alone took me over a month.
  </p>
  <p>We've put a lot of work into this room, and doing it all ourselves, we decided to spring for a high-end, antique reproduction wallpaper. And let me tell you - the pictures do not do it justice. The texture, sheen, depth, it's just beautiful. We were so impressed with the sample that we ordered 750 dollars of wallpaper within a minute of opening the sample.
  </p>
  <p>HOWEVER, this is an antique reproduction, to a fault. There are two things about antique wallpapers I didn't know:
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/living-wallpaper-trim.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>1. You have to cut your own seams. To do that, you use these ridiculously tiny marks, spaced about 3 feet apart, and then you carefully, with a straight edge, cut the seam using a razor blade. It's also handprinted, which means they're not even perfectly lined up.
  </p>
  <p>2. These wallpapers are extremely delicate when compared to modern vinyl backed ones. They're printed on some sort of high quality, organic harvested clouds or someshit, because they tear super easily. But they are beautiful.
  </p>
  <p>At this point, I'm not even sure I'm capable of doing this, but we ordered $750 worth of wallpaper, so I'm doing it.
  </p>
