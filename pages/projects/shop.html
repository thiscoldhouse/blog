  <h2>The Shop</h2>
  <p>Having a place to work is pretty important for someone who cares enough about this sort of thing to have a DIY blog. Fortunately, like any good old farmhouse, we have plenty of outbuildings where setting up a shop would be reasonable. Unfortunately, like any good old farmhouse, most of them are in a shit state, often to be taken literally.

  <p>Of course, I forgot to take a picture at the very beginning of the project, but here we are halfway through clearing out the room

  <p>As I said, seen better days. It was once an exension added to the area of the barn where that delicious milk was extracted from our bovine friends.
  </p><p>First, I went to town with a sawzall, cut all that old wooden fence from its supports, cut it to manageable sizes, and I dragged it out into a burnpile. Around here, I had the great fortune of having a brother in law who just graudated high school and desperately loves his truck, which happened to need a new transmission, so I hired him as an assistant to finish cleaning out and whitewash the room.

  <p>This is the room all cleaned up and whitewashed! Whitewashing is kind of a pain, but it's cheap! You mix lime with salt in water, and then you just cover everything with this pretty watery pseudo-paint. As you're doing it, it's hard to tell what's what because it doesn't cure to white for a few hours. It's also messy and pretty caustic, so wear gloves, glasses, and a mask, in no particular order. I made sure to let my brother in law handle the bulk of this part.

  <p>More pics before we fill the room back up again, I apologize for the quality, the room was very dusty, dark, and I'm a DIYer not a photographer:</p>

  <p>You can see that the room is pretty dark, lit entirely with three exposed light bulbs. There's also that black pipe in the background, which is the water supply for the cows in the pasture behind the barn. First thing we did was reroute that so it doesn't just dangle in the center of the room, and then we got to work building shelves behind it.

  <p> First two shelves assembled, just the third story to go! You can also see in this near post that I've started to run the wire/conduit for the outlets. Thankfully, the room arleady had a dedicated subpanel, so I ran a new 20 amp circuit for the tools, and extended the existing lighting with old tracklights I took down in the kitchen. I made sure to use GFCIs and test the ground as I worked, it is a barn after all, it gets humid in there! I also used wire rated for outdoor use, just in case.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shelves fully assembled! You can see the tracklights are up to, and they're in progress being wired.

    Let there be light! Track lights are wired up, tools are plugged in, some stuff is already being organized on the shelves. Also, a magical work table appeared - my brother in law did that while I was working, so sadly no progress pictures were taken. But in a way that's appropriate, because from my perspective, the table just magically appeared - not feeling I have often around here.
  </p><p>
    Also in the category of having no progress pics: shop sink! You can see it on the right of the first photo below! We just put a T into the existing water pump, and added the old sink from the kitchen demo. Unfortunately, I probably have to shut it off in the winter for now, but a shop sink for half the year is better than none!

  <p> Here, I still have to finish cleaning the stuff up from the old poop trench, which I plan on filling so I don't kill myself walking around the shop. I also plan on widening that back door enough to get a car or tractor in there so I can truly live the dream - fixing a car inside a shop instead of crawling around on the ice!
  </p>
  <p>
    I still have a lot of organizing to do from almost a year of working on a house with no dedicated shop area. I've got temporary work stations set up all over the place, so I've got a solid couple days of consolidating tools and organizing and such.
  </p>
  <p>
  That's all for now!
