  <h2>The Chicken Coop: Theodora's Palace</h2>
  <p>
    Theodora is one of the chickens. Well, she's not *just* one of the chickens, she's the most important chicken. She's Theodora, empress of hens. Here she is, skeptically lording over all who enter.

    This is a two part project. The first part involves converting an old milk shed into a chicken coop. The second attempts to automate watering the chickens through winter, without electricity or human intervention.
  </p>
  <h3>Part 1: Conversion</h3>
  <p>
    This old milk shed had a big milk fridge in it, and the walls were particle board. The old compressor was pretty cool, actually:

  <p>
    I considered seeing if it would run, but I had visions of explaining to an insurance agent why I need a new barn and decided against it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the old milk fridge, unfortunately, was a nasty, stainless steel contraption that had been assembled in place before the shed was built. It had to be cut to pieces to be removed. So I take out the sawzall, and immediately learn that this building has a wasp infestation, and they don't take kindly to the racket of sawing up this old fridge. After being stung twice, I suited up as if it was -20F outside (in July), and got back to work.

    Here's where I left it the first time:

    Sawing some more, and demoing a few walls while I'm at it. The scale of the wasp infestation is becoming apparent, as you can see in this picture:

  <p>
    At this point, I can only work first thing in the morning and in the evening, and even then only for a little while until the wasps would really come after me and start stinging my coat. But after many sessions, we have a disassembled fridge! And also a random pink children's bike that was in the milk shed!

  <p>I apologize for the quality of this picture, but at this point I could only work at night to avoid being stung repeatedly!

    When I did get stung, it was always through a glove, because that was the weak point in my armor

    The nice thing about this project is you're done when the demo is done! All you have to do is add some nesting boxes and places for them to roost. I used these litter containers, and they work wonderfully!

  <h3> Part 2: Overcomplicating it!</h3>
  <p>
    Having chickens is cool, but in the winter, their water freezes. Normal people would just break the ice every morning, but I am not a normal person. Instead of spending 1 minute on this task every winter morning, I spent several days connecting my chicken coop to my spring well, so that there would be a continual flow of water from underground.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we dig a trench and run the black pipe!

    Then, we build retaining walls! That requires moving huge rocks!

  <p>
    For the inside, I put up an old sink we had lying around. We'll put a 5 gallon bucket inside the sink basin, the water overflows from the bucket into the drain.

    And here it is, in action!
