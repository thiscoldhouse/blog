  <h2>This Warm House - Phase 1</h2>
  <p>Last winter was a particularly cold one up here in Vermont, and having just moved here, we were at the mercy of whatever winterization was done by the previous owners. Well, turns out, they hadn't done much. In January, during a particularly brutal run of subzero temperatures, my morning routine looked something like:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wake up</li>
      <li>Put on all of the clothes</li>
      <li>Walk downstairs</li>
      <li>Break the layer of ice on the cats' water bowls</li>
      <li>Start a fire from last night's embers in the wood stove</li>
      <li>Turn off all the space heaters strategically pointed at walls with plumbing inside them</li>
      <li>Make coffee</li>
      <li>Thaw out next to the stove as it warms the house to a balmy 55 degrees</li>
    </ul>
  <p>One obvious area of improvement is our windows. The house has the original windows, and with their 200 years of charm and character, it would be a shame to rip them out for some argon-filled quadruple-paned hideous but much warmer monstruosity. It would also be a shame to freeze to death, so something had to be done to reduce the light breeze that can be felt in the living room, even with the windows down.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I decided to two things: install storm windows, and build window inserts for each window.
  </p>
  <h3>Insert Frame Construction</h3>
  <p> My original plan was to crank these out, however, since the windows are antique, I of course had to carefully measure and make each window custom. There are over 20 windows on the bottom floor of the house alone, so I really have my work cut out for me here.
  </p>
  <p>First, I have to set up a workspace. I used the same saw horses, old countertop, and saw set up I used in the living room, but I moved it out to the porch in the time-honored New England tradition of preparing for winter while enjoying summer.

    The process here is going to be pretty straightforward. Cut and measure, screw together. Rinse and repeat. Here's the first cuts:

  </div>
  <p>
    Sometimes you're lucky, and two windows are similar enough you can knock them out at the same time:
  </p>
  <div class="inline-image">

  </div>
  <p>So efficient!</p>
  <p>Then I just cranked through a bazillion of them and stacked them.</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhousestacked.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>Next step is to felt the edges. I tried to cut each one so there's at least a half inch all around. I bought a big piece of felt, which was then cut into strips and stapled to the outside edge to create a weather seal.</p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhousefelt.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>Testing the fit!</p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhousefit.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>Pretty satisfied with that seal</p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhouseseal.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>Next step is to roll out the plastic and staple it to the frame, like this:</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhousestaple.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>And you're done!</p>
  <div class="inline-image-vertical">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhousedone.jpg">
  </div>
  <h3>Storm windows</h3>
  <p>Now that the inserts are done (okay I lied, I still haven't finished stapling most of the plastic, but close enough), it's time for storm windows. Storm windows can be expensive, so I spent a month or so checking craigslist every day for cheap or free ones, and I hit the mother load! I found a "free if you move them" stack of more storm windows than I needed about 2 hours away, so I got in the truck and grabbed them!</p>
  <p>As for the process of putting up storm windows, it's pretty damn straightforward. You caulk the top and sides, but not the bottom so condensation has somewhere to drain, and you screw them to the exterior of the window. I recommend cleaning the outside of the window first, too, but you don't have to. No judgement. I did, though.</p>
  <p>Caulking:</p>

  <p>Cleaning:</p>

  <p>Putting them up:</p>

    <img src="images/thiswarmhouseup.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>And that's pretty much it. Here's a before and after:</p>
  <div class="inline-image">

  <div class="inline-image">

  </div>
  <p>Another after:</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/thiswarmhouseafter2.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>All in all, pretty unobtrusive! Hopefully, with the inserts and the storm windows, we get to keep the charm of the antique windows without being miserable. I'll update mid-winter. Wish us luck!
