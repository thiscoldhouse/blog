  <h2>The Vestibule</h2>
  <p>I'm not sure that "Vestibule" is the right name for it, but it's so much more exciting than mudroom I think we're going to run with it. I suppose entryway would probably work too. Anyway, here's the vestibule:</p>

  </div>
  <p>
    The motivation behind the vestibule was many fold, it's partly an installment of the This Warm House series, in which I foolishly attempt to weatherproof the house, and it's partly because there was no real entryway - as the house stands now, the front door opens directly into the living room. We thought it'd be pleasant to have something attractive to serve as a barrier between our living room and the elements.
  </p>
  <p>As I'm sure will continue to be a theme, there's still a bit left to do. It's currently only primed, not painted. Since we'll be painting the house in the spring and we're not quite settled on colors yet, it seemed wise to do it all in one go.

  <p>Another angle:</p>

  <p>A bit closer:</p>

    As you can see, painter's tape and window plastic coverings are still on.
  </p>
  <p>As for the build process, it's a pretty straightforward non-load-bearing framing job. Like all good projects, it starts with a crowbar and an overloaded truck! I had to remove some old trim:

  </div>

  <p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/truckwithdoors.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>Then starts the framing. I don't own a framing gun, so I do my framing with a hammer. I'm sure that will change for bigger projects, but with such a small job, it's really not too bad. Here's the hammering:

  <p>First piece up:</p>

  <p>Other side up too:</p>

  </div>
  <p>
    Here we have all the windows and doors basically framed out. I prefer to do the working on the ground first and lift into place, but on the front I couldn't because I was working alone, so I did it in place.

  <p>Putting the cripple studs in:</p>

  <p>Skipping a few steps (sorry) here we are with windows and doors in. You can start to get a senes for what it'll look like</p>
  <div class="inline-image">
    <img src="images/windowsdoors.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>And now begins the trim work, which is usually the part of the project where my interest in documenting begins to wane.</p>

  <p>From there, it's painting and caulking, and that brings us back to where we started!</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading! A big shoutout to This Cold House inlaws, who helped a lot with caulking and priming during their visit!</p>
