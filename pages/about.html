  <p>Hello and welcome to This Cold House!</p>
  <p>I started this blog in the cold, cold winter of 2017/2018 to chronicle my misadventures in DIY as we foolheartedly plunged into the renovation of a 200 year old farmhouse. In it, I'll do my best to keep you up to date on what we've fixed and what needs fixing, and hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes, because I never seem to. </p>
  <p>Most of the fun on the site can be found in the <a href="#projects">projects</a> page.
  <p>If you're curious about the technical details of the blog itself, check out the <a href="#blog">blog</a> page. I built the blog myself (this is DIY blog, after all) and it's open source.</p>
