  <p>Hello and welcome to This Cold House!</p>
  <p>That's me, on the left, in my <a href="#projects/shop">shop</a>.</p>
  <p>I started this blog in the cold, cold winter of 2017/2018 to chronicle my misadventures in DIY as I foolheartedly plunged into the renovation of a 200 year old farmhouse. Since then, it has morphed to a place where I write about all the dumb stuff I get up to. I hope you enjoy!</p>
  <p>I also have an instagram, where I post semi-regularly about life in This Cold House: <a href="https://instagram.com/thiscoldhouse">@thiscoldhouse.</a></p>
