  <p>Hello and welcome to This Cold House!</p>
  <p>That's me, on the left, in my <a href="#projects/shop">shop</a>.</p>
  <p>I also have an instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/thiscoldhouse">@thiscoldhouse.</a></p>
  <p>I started this blog in the cold, cold winter of 2017/2018 to chronicle my misadventures in DIY as I foolheartedly plunged into the renovation of a 200 year old farmhouse. I also include other miscellaneous projects--really anything about living in This Cold House</p>
  <p>If you're curious about the technical details of the blog itself, check out the aptly if unimaginatively named <a href="#blog">technical details</a> page. I built the blog myself (this is DIY blog, after all) and it's open source.</p>
